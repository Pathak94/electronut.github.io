I have two decades of expertise in software design and development, as
well as experience in various aspects of hardware design and
prototyping. I have engineering degrees from IIT Bombay and Penn State
University, USA. I am the author of Python Playground (No Starch
Press, USA), and the creator of [snapVCC][1].

I am available for consulting and custom work in the area of
microcontrollers and firmware development - WiFi (ESP8266, CC3200), BLE (Nordic), and Atmel AVR.

## Customer Testimonials

*Electronut Labs delivered excellent results and in a very short time frame. Our original design concept took a last minute turn and left my team and I with a platform we knew very little about…BLE. Electronut labs was able to write us the code we needed using the hardware that was required and got us up and running. Their documentation of the process was clean and neat. The communication was easy even though we are on separate sides of the world. I will be using Electronut Labs in the future for sure.*

*Over the last year, I've had Mahesh work on a web site
development project for me. I have been very pleased with
the results and the quality of communications with him, and
resolving issues with project specifications/requirements.
He produced results in a timely manner, provided well written
documentation, and communicated fluently in English.
He also provided support as needed. I am currently planning
to engage him on another project to leverage his skills in
Python and embedded processor systems development.*
