I have two decades of expertise in software design and development, as
well as experience in various aspects of hardware design and
prototyping. I have engineering degrees from IIT Bombay and Penn State
University, USA. I am the author of Python Playground (No Starch
Press, USA), and the creator of [snapVCC][1].

I am available for consulting and custom work in the area of
microcontrollers and firmware development - WiFi (ESP8266, CC3200), BLE (Nordic), and Atmel AVR.
