I have two decades of expertise in software design and development, as
well as experience in various aspects of hardware design and
prototyping. I am also the author of Python Playground (No Starch
Press, USA).

I am available for consulting and custom work in the area of
electronics, circuit design, microcontrollers, firmware development,
and architecture of connected systems that use WiFi and BLE. For
project inquiries, contact me at <a href="mailto:info@electronut.in">info@electronut.in</a> (Please note
that I require a minimum of 20 hours of work to take on a project.)
