I have two decades of expertise in software design and development, as
well as experience in various aspects of hardware design and
prototyping. I have engineering degrees from IIT Bombay and Penn State
University, USA. I am also the author of Python Playground (No Starch
Press, USA).

I am available for consulting and custom work in the area of
electronics, circuit design, microcontrollers, firmware development,
and architecture of connected systems that use WiFi and BLE. For
project inquiries, contact me at <a

that I require a minimum of 20 hours of engagement to take on a
project.)
