        <em>
        Electronut Labs delivered excellent results and in a very short time
        frame. Our original design concept took a last minute turn and left
        my team and I with a platform we knew very little about…BLE.
        Electronut labs was able to write us the code we needed using the
        hardware that was required and got us up and running. Their
        documentation of the process was clean and neat. The communication was
        easy even though we are on separate sides of the world. I will be using
        Electronut Labs in the future for sure.

        <em>
        Over the last year, I’ve had Mahesh work on a web site development
        project for me. I have been very pleased with the results and the
        quality of communications with him, and resolving issues with project
        specifications/requirements. He produced results in a timely manner,
        provided well written documentation, and communicated fluently in English.
        He also provided support as needed. I am currently planning to engage
        him on another project to leverage his skills in Python and
        embedded processor systems development.

          Electronut Labs has developed a great solution for wireless monitoring of sensors. The integrated solution encompassed interfacing hardware, embedded code and an android app for monitoring the sensor. The entire system was delivered in a compact custom package in a very short time frame. Will definitely engage with them for our hardware projects.
