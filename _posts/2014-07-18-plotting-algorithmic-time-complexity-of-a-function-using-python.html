<p>I have been reading <a href="http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/index.html">Miller & Ranum's e-book on Python/Algorithms</a>. (A superb book which is also free online.) While looking through their chapter on <em>Algorithm Analysis</em>, I took their idea of using the Python <code>Timer</code> and <code>timeit</code> methods a bit forward to create a simple plotting scheme using <code>matplotlib</code>. </p>

<p>Here is the code. You can add in your own function here and plot the time complexity.</p>
<p>The code is quite simple. Perhaps the only interesting thing here is the use of <code>partial</code> to pass in the function and the <code>N</code> parameter into <code>Timer</code>. </p>

<p>Here is the output.</p>
