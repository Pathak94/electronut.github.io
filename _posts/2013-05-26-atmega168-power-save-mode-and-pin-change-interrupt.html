<p>Most times your microcontroller is running in a loop, waiting for something to happen - like a button press. All this while it is consuming power, and this could be an issue, especially if you are running the circuit from a battery. To counter this problem, there are ways of reducing the power consumption of your chip. Here are the various "sleep modes" supported by the ATmega168. </p>
<p>[Table reproduced from Atmel ATmega168 datasheet for illustrative purpose]</p>

<p>In a previous post about an <a href="http://electronut.in/ambient-light-sensor-using-an-op-amp-comparator/">Ambient Light sensor using an Op-Amp Comparator</a>, I mentioned that we would be using the op-amp output to "wake up" an ATmega168. So here, we will be using the "power-save" mode from the above table, and use a pin-change interrupt to wake up from this sleep mode.</p>
<p>The setup used is shown below in the 2 schematics I had posted before. The output Vo from the op-amp should be connected to the pin 14 of the ATmega168 (PCINT0/PB0). Also, in this case, we are not using serial output, so you can remove the connections to the FTDI adapter. </p>

<p>Here is what the circuit looks like, hooked up on a breadboard:</p>
<p><a href="http://electronut.in/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1451.jpg"><img src="assets/IMG_1451.jpg" alt="ATmega168-power-save-breadboard" width="800" height="504" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-271" /></a></p>
<p>This is the how the program works:</p>
<p><!-- begin list --></p>
<ul>
<li>
When the program starts, start the 16-bit timer, set to fire an interrupt every 3 seconds. Start the timer only if pin 14 is low. (This means that the light level is high in our sensor circuit.).
</li>
<li>
When the chip is not sleeping, it will be flashing an LED attached to pin 6.
</li>
<li>
When the 16-bit timer interrupt happens, set a flag (a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatile_variable">volatile variable</a>) so that the main loop reads this flag and puts the chip to sleep mode. It will also turn the LED off at this point.
</li>
<li>
Set up a pin change interrupt on PCINT0 for any logical change in input. When the interrupt fires, if it was caused by a rising edge (ie., light to dark), wake up the chip, and stop the 16-bit timer. If the interrupt was caused by a falling edge (ie., dark to light), re-start the 16-bit timer.
</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- end list --></p>
<p>You can read about pin-change interrupts and the 16-bit timer in the Atmel ATmega168 datasheet.</p>
<p>The complete code listing is below. The opening comments in the code also have all the required build commands.</p>
