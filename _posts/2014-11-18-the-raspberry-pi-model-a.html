<p>Just got my hands on the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-a-plus/">Raspberry Pi Model A+</a>. <!--more--></p>
<p><a href="http://electronut.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_4438.jpg"><img src="assets/IMG_4438-259x300.jpg" alt="rpi-A+-box" width="259" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-874" /></a></p>
<p>Here is a photo comparing it my old Model B. (Still working on a robot project.)</p>
<p><a href="http://electronut.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_4437.jpg"><img src="assets/IMG_4437-300x115.jpg" alt="rpi-A+" width="300" height="115" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-873" /></a></p>
<p>The A+ is smaller, cheaper and lighter than the B and B+ models. You lose extra USB ports, ethernet, and you have less RAM (256 MB vs. 512 MB).</p>
<p>Setup was really easy, as I had cloned my previous Pi's SD card using the procedure described <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup#Flashing_the_SD_card_using_Mac_OSX">here</a>. Then, as described in my note about <a href="http://electronut.in/starting-raspberry-pi-wifi-ssh-and-gpio/" title="Starting Raspberry Pi: WiFi, ssh and GPIO">setting up the pi the first time</a>, I just changed the IP address and I was good to go! (Since it has only one USB Port, I first used it for my USB wireless keyboard and then plugged in a USB WiFi adapter after I was done with setup.) </p>
<p>Awesome. :-)</p>
