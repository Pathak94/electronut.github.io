<p>This is a small project that I worked on last year. I have a desk made of dark wood, and it was very difficult to see what was inside the bottom draw. I put together a simple circuit with the schematic below - something which lit up a few strips of LEDs using a magnet stuck to the side of the door to switch a transistor on/off.</p>

<p>I also made a video with my old iPhone 3GS and uploaded it to youtube.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wFeQDVLr_9k" height="315" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>What blew my mind was the popularity of the post - in a few weeks, over 15000 people had seen the video, and the project was picked up by <a href="http://hackaday.com/2012/12/21/adding-task-lighting-inside-a-desk/">Hackaday</a> and <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5973589/add-automatic-led-lights-for-desk-drawers">LifeHacker</a>.</p>
<p>This has been a great inspiration for me to share the projects I am working on.</p>
