I am happy to announce the release of my book <strong>Python Playground</strong> published by No Starch Press, USA. It's a fun romp through Python, applying the language to a number of interesting projects that include a <em>Boids</em> simulation, an OpenGL based <em>volume renderer</em>, and an <em>autostereogram</em> generator. It also has a few hardware projects that use the Arduino microcontroller platform and the tiny Raspberry Pi computer. I hope you check it out! 

I will keep this page updated with information related to the book.

<p>Please email me at <a href="mailto:info@electronut.in">info@electronut.in</a> for any questions on the book. You can follow me on Twitter to get latest updates on the book, as well as my other hardware and software projects:</p>

<h2 id="code">Installing Source Code for the Book's Projects</h2>
<p>You can download source code for the book's project from the link below:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/electronut/pp">https://github.com/electronut/pp</a></p>
<p>Use the “Download ZIP” option the the above link to retrieve the code. Once you get the code you need to add the common folder to your <code>PYTHONPATH</code> environment variable so that modules that use these common python files can find them. On Windows, you can do this by creating a <code>PYTHONPATH</code> environment variable, or adding to one if it already exists. On OS X, you can add the following line to your <code>.profile</code> file (Create one if needed.) in your home directory.</p>
<p><code>export PYTHONPATH=path_to_common_folder:$PYTHONPATH<br />
</code></p>
<p>Linux users can do something similar to OS X, in their <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.bash_profile</code>, as appropriate.</p>
