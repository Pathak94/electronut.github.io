## Company Philosophy

electronut Labs is a *non-startup*, in the spirit of the book *Rework*
by Fried & Hansson. What we mean by this, is that phrases like "Exit
Strategy" and "Series A" have no meaning here. We are a small group of
engineers, and our long term vision is to create a viable business
with a portfolio of unique and useful electronics hardware. Our only 
commitment is towards our customers, whom we hope to delight, surprise, 
and support.

## Work Environment

At electronut Labs, we don't believe in packing people into a tiny
room like sardines in a can and cracking the whip. (Talk about fishy
analogies!) We believe that really cool ideas in Engineering don't
come out of textbooks, but from a healthy exposure to the creative
world of Arts. We want our engineers to be inspired by life, and for
that they need to have a life outside of work. When we are at work, we
work without distraction from umpteen different beeping gizmos. You
won't find hour long meetings, TPS reports to file, or two-hour
lunches here. We go home to the family when there's still daylight
left.

## Jobs

We are very selective about whom we hire. If you have a passion for
building things, are comfortable coding up microcontrollers, designing
PCBs, building electronics circuits, and have a bunch of published
projects on the web, we'd love to hear from you.

        <strong>Mahesh Venkitachalam</strong>, <i>Founder & Chief TroubleMaker</i>. <br/>
        Smitten with electronics since childhood, Mahesh has managed to make 
        himself even more dangerous by learing some programming. Loves 
        photography, reading 
        (especially Sci-Fi), art, and good cinema. 
        Has a tendency to mutter "comma, space!" while reading articles 
        written by others.

        Only a few months away from graduation, this young engineer is learning 
        electronics and programming at an alarming rate. He keeps the energy 
        levels high at the lab. When he's not erasing bootloaders, his mind is 
        on sketching, sports, gaming, or motorbikes with large engines.

        spreadsheets, and gets agitated at inefficient eateries.
