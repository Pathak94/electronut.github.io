        Smitten with electronics since childhood, Mahesh has managed to make

        photography, reading
        (especially Sci-Fi), art, and good cinema. This author of *Python Playground* (No Starch Press, USA)
        has a tendency to mutter "comma, space!" while reading articles
        written by others.
