## Company Philosophy

electronut Labs is a *non-startup*, in the spirit of the book *Rework*
by Fried & Hansson. What we mean by this, is that phrases like "Exit
Strategy" and "Series A" have no meaning here. We are a small group of
engineers, and our long term vision is to create a viable business
with a portfolio of unique and useful electronics hardware. Our only 
commitment is towards our customers, whom we hope to delight, surprise, 
and support.

## Work Environment

At electronut Labs, we don't believe in packing people into a tiny
room like sardines in a can and cracking the whip. (Talk about fishy
analogies!) We believe that really cool ideas in Engineering don't
come out of textbooks, but from a healthy exposure to the creative
world of Arts. We want our engineers to be inspired by life, and for
that they need to have a life outside of work. When we are at work, we
work without distraction from umpteen different beeping gizmos. You
won't find hour long meetings, TPS reports to file, or two-hour
lunches here. We go home to the family when there's still daylight
left.

## Jobs

We are very selective about whom we hire. If you have a passion for
building things, are comfortable coding up microcontrollers, designing
PCBs, building electronics circuits, and have a bunch of published
projects on the web, we'd love to hear from you.
