I am happy to announce the release of my book <strong>Python Playground</strong> published by **No Starch Press**, USA. It's a fun romp through Python, applying the language to a number of interesting projects that include a <em>Boids</em> simulation, an OpenGL based <em>volume renderer</em>, and an <em>autostereogram</em> generator. It also has a few hardware projects that use the Arduino microcontroller platform and the tiny Raspberry Pi computer.

snapVCC is a tiny 3.3 V / 5 V voltage regulator that snaps right on top of
a 9 volt battery. It is a highly portable and convenient power supply for
your electronics projects.
