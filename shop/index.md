##Python Playground

I am happy to announce the release of my book <strong>Python Playground</strong> published by **No Starch Press**, USA. It's a fun romp through Python, applying the language to a number of interesting projects that include a <em>Boids</em> simulation, an OpenGL based <em>volume renderer</em>, and an <em>autostereogram</em> generator. It also has a few hardware projects that use the Arduino microcontroller platform and the tiny Raspberry Pi computer.

snapVCC is a tiny 3.3 V / 5 V voltage regulator that snaps right on top of
a 9 volt battery. It is a highly portable and convenient power supply for
your electronics projects.

## nRF51822 Adapter PCB

![nRF51-E3BO]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2015/09/nRF51-E3BO-back.jpg)

The nRF51822 is a popular BLE SoC which I have been working with the
past few months. I am using the Nordic nRF51-DK, but I want to use
cheaper modules for embedding in projects. There a number of cheap (â‰ˆ
USD 5) nRF51822 modules available on aliexpress and other sites, but
most of them use dual 2x9 2mm pitch male header pins, making them very
difficult to use. I have teamed up with Sandeep Patil
(exploreembedded.com) to create a simple adapter PCB which will make
it easy for using these modules in a project - either on a breadboard,
or as a standalone board.
