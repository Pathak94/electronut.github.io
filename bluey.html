      <strong>Bluey</strong> is a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) development board with Temperature,
      Humidity, Ambient Light and Accelerometer sensors. Bluey uses the Nordic
      nRF52832 BLE SoC (System on a Chip) which has an ARM Cortex-M4F CPU and a
      2.4 GHz radio that supports BLE and other proprietary wireless protocols.
      It also supports NFC, and in fact the board comes with a built-in NFC PCB antenna.
